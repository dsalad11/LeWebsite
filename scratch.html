    <h2>LeLearn</h2>
    <p>LeBron James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio. Raised by his single mother, Gloria James, LeBron faced numerous hardships during his childhood, including frequent moves and financial instability. Despite these challenges, his talent for basketball was evident from a young age. He gained national attention while playing at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School, where he was widely regarded as the best high school basketball player in the country. His performances earned him media coverage and accolades, setting the stage for his leap directly into the NBA.

        LeBron was selected as the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He quickly made an impact, winning Rookie of the Year and becoming the face of the franchise. Over his first stint with Cleveland, he developed into one of the league's top players but faced challenges in securing a championship. In 2010, he made a controversial move to join the Miami Heat, where he won two NBA championships (2012, 2013) alongside Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. After four seasons in Miami, he returned to Cleveland and delivered on his promise to bring the city a title, famously leading the Cavaliers to a historic 3â€“1 comeback win over the Golden State Warriors in the 2016 NBA Finals.
        
        In 2018, LeBron signed with the Los Angeles Lakers, continuing to demonstrate his excellence on the court while also growing his influence off it. He led the Lakers to an NBA Championship in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic-shortened season, further cementing his legacy as one of the greatest players of all time. Over his career, LeBron has become the NBA's all-time leading scorer and earned numerous MVP awards and All-Star selections. Beyond basketball, he has made significant contributions through philanthropy, including opening the I PROMISE School for at-risk youth in his hometown, solidifying his impact both as an athlete and a leader in his community.</p>
